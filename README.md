Hello, world This is my first python project and also my first time utilizing python programming language in practical manner. 
Well this is very self explanatory, it is basically a mini ATM that you can play around with. 
Feature of this Mini ATM includes:

  1. Check Pin
  2. Change Pin
  3. Check Balance
  4. Debit / Withdraw
  5. Save / Deposit
  6. Get out
  7. Print transaction summary


HOW TO USE THE ATM:
1. First you need to download the files which is linked in the repository
   Those files include:
    - customer.py
    - atm_card.py
    - atm_program.py

2. And then you just run the program from atm_program.py (this is the main code for the app and contains imported code from
    customer.py & atm_card.py).
